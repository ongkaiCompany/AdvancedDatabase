Hi there! Welcome to this repository!

My team and I developed a star-schema data warehouse based on the well-known Northwind retail database. Northwind is a classic sample dataset created by Microsoft and widely used in database tutorials. It represents the operations of a fictional company, “Northwind Traders,” which imports and exports specialty foods globally.

In this project, several dimension tables were implemented as Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimensions, following our tutor’s requirements. Within this repository, you will find SQL scripts for:

Building the OLTP system

Creating the Data Warehouse

Performing both the initial and incremental Data Warehouse loads

Generating Business Intelligence reports

For full documentation, including the star schema, SQL outputs, and Excel visualisations, please refer to the uploaded PDF report.
